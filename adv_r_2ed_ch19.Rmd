# IV Metaprogramming - Chapter 19 - Quasiquotation

## 19.1 Introduction

```{r}
library(rlang)
library(purrr)
```

## 19.2 Motivation

Imagine you’re creating a lot of strings by joining together words.

```{r}
paste("Good", "morning", "Hadley")
paste("Good", "morning", "Alice")
```

You are sick and tired of writing all those quotes, and instead you just want to use bare words.

```{r}
cement <- function(...) {
  args <- ensyms(...)
  paste(purrr::map(args, as_string), collapse = " ")
}

# args_blah <- syms(exprs(Good, morning))
# args_blah
# purrr::map(args_blah, as_string)
# list("one", "two")
# paste(list("one", "two"), collapse = " ")

cement(Good, morning, Hadley)
cement(Good, morning, Alice)
```

This function is nice because we no longer need to type quotation marks. The problem comes when we want to use variables.

```{r}
name <- "Hadley"
time <- "morning"

paste("Good", time, name)
```

Obvs, this doesn't work the way we want with `cement()`.

```{r}
cement(Good, time, name)
```

We need some way to explicitly unquote the input to tell `cement()` to remove the automatic quote marks. Here we need time and name to be treated differently to Good. Quasiquotation gives us a standard tool to do so: `!!`, called "unquote", and pronounced bang-bang. `!!` tells a quoting function to drop the implicit quotes.

```{r}
cement(Good, !!time, !!name)
```

It’s useful to compare `cement()` and `paste()` directly. `paste()` evaluates its arguments, so we must quote where needed; `cement()` quotes its arguments, so we must unquote where needed.

```{r}
paste("Good", time, name)
cement(Good, !!time, !!name)
```

### 19.2.1 Vocabulary

The distinction between quoted and evaluated arguments is important:

* An **evaluated argument** obeys R’s usual evaluation rules.
* A **quoted argument** is captured by the function, and is processed in some custom way.

`paste()` evaluates all its arguments; `cement()` quotes all its arguments.

If you’re ever unsure about whether an argument is quoted or evaluated, try executing the code outside of the function. If it doesn’t work or does something different, then that argument is quoted. For example, you can use this technique to determine that the first argument to `library()` is quoted:

```{r}
library(MASS) # MASS here is quoted... it works as an arg in a fxn

MASS # see... it doesn't work outside the function call as an arg

detach("package:MASS", unload = TRUE)
```

### 19.2.2 Exercises

1. For each function in the following base R code, identify which arguments are quoted and which are evaluated.

```{r}
library(MASS) # `MASS` quoted

mtcars2 <- subset(mtcars, cyl == 4) # `mtcars` eval'd, `cyl == 4` quoted 

with(mtcars2, sum(vs)) # `mtcars2` eval'd, `sum(vs)` quoted
sum(mtcars2$am) # `mtcars2$am` evaluated

rm(mtcars2) # mtcars eval'd
```

2. For each function in the following tidyverse code, identify which arguments are quoted and which are evaluated.

```{r}
library(dplyr) # `dplyr` quoted
library(ggplot2) # `ggplot2` quoted

by_cyl <- mtcars %>% # `mtcars` eval'd
  group_by(cyl) %>%  # `cyl` quoted
  summarise(mean = mean(mpg)) # `mean` quoted, `mean(mpg)` quoted, `mgp` quoted

ggplot(by_cyl, aes(cyl, mean)) + geom_point() # `by_cyl` eval'd
# `aes(cyl, mean)` eval'd
#   `cyl`, `mean` quoted
```


## 19.3 Quoting

The first part of quasiquotation is quotation. Quotation is capturing an expression without evaluting it.

### 19.3.1 Capturing expressions

Four important quoting functions: `expr()`, `exprs()`, `enexpr()`, `enexprs()`

`expr()`: for capturing a single expression supplied by programmer during interactive exploration

```{r}
expr(x + y)

expr(1 / 2 / 3)
```

`exprs()`: for capturing multiple expressions (separated by commas) supplied by programmer during interactive exploration

```{r}
exprs(x + y, 1 / 2 / 3)
```

`enexpr()`: for capturing a single expression passed by a user to a function

```{r}
f1 <- function(x) expr(x)

f1(a + b + c) # doesn't work how we'd like
```

```{r}
f2 <- function(x) enexpr(x)

f2(a + b + c) # b/c we used `enexpr()` this now works how we'd like
```

`enexprs()`: for capturing muliple expressions (separated by commas) passed by a user to a function

```{r}
f3 <- function(...) enexprs(...)

f3(x = 1, y = 10 * z)
```

### 19.3.2 Capturing symbols

In the event you want to capture a variable name instead of an arbitrary expression, there are four important functions: `sym()`, `syms()`, `ensym()`, `ensyms()`

`sym()`: for capturing a single variable name (symbol) from a character supplied by the programmer during interactive exploration

```{r}
sym("a")
```

`syms()`: for capturing multiple variable names (symbols) from a character vector or list supplied by the programmer during interactive exploration

```{r}
syms(c("a", "b"))
syms(list("c", "d"))
```

`ensym()`: for capturing a single variable name (symbol) from a character or symbol passed by a user to a function

```{r}
f4 <- function(x) ensym(x)

f4("x")
f4(x)
```

`ensyms()`: for capturing multiple variable names (symbols) passed by a user to a function

```{r}
f5 <- function(...) ensyms(...)

f5("x")
f5(x)
f5("a", "b")
f5(c, d, e)
```

### 19.3.5 Summary

When quoting (i.e. capturing code), there are two important distinctions:

1. Is it supplied by the developer of the code or the user of the code? I.e. is it fixed (supplied in the body of the function) or varying (supplied via an argument)?
2. Do you want to capture a single expression or multiple expressions?

|   | Developer | User |
|---|---|---|
| One | `expr()` | `enexpr()` |
| Many | `exprs()` | `enexprs()` |

### 19.3.6 Exercises

1. How is `expr()` implemented Look at its source code.

`expr()` is just a wrapper function that passes it's argument (`expr`) to `enxpr()`.

Here's the code:

```{r}
function (expr) 
{
  enexpr(expr)
}
```

2. Compare and contrast the following two functions. Can you predict the output before running them?

```{r}
f1 <- function(x, y) {
  exprs(x = x, y = y)
}

f2 <- function(x, y) {
  enexprs(x = x, y = y)
}

# f1(a + b, c + d)
# f2(a + b, c + d)
```

Because `f1()` uses `exprs()`, it will output 

```
$x
x

$y
y
```

no matter what's passed to it.

`f2()` in this case will output 

```
$x 
a + b

$y
c + d
```

Let's test them!

```{r}
f1(a + b, c + d)
f2(a + b, c + d)
```

3. What happens if you try to use `enexpr()` with an expression (i.e. `enexpr(x + y)`? What happens if `enexpr()` is passed a missing argument?

```{r}
enexpr(x + y)
```

An error is thrown saying that the argument to `enexpr()` must be a argument symbol.

```{r}
f1 <- function(x) enexpr(x)

f2 <- function(x, y) enexprs(x, y)

f1()
f2(x = 1, )

is.null(f())
f1() == ""

is.null(f2(x = 1, )[[2]])
f2(x = 1, )[[2]] == ""
```

It returns an empty string apparently.

4. How are `exprs(a)` and `exprs(a = )` different? Think about both the input and the output.

```{r}
exprs(a)
```

In `exprs(a)` above, `a` is an expression that is captured.

```{r}
exprs(a = )
```

In `exprs(a = )` above, `a` isn't an expression but a location reference in a argument list (a pairlist).

5. What are other differences between `exprs()` and `alist()`? Read the documentation for the named arguments of `exprs()` to find out.

_Dunno._

6. The documentation for substitute() says:

> Substitution takes place by examining each component of the parse tree as follows:
> 
> * If it is not a bound symbol in env, it is unchanged.
> * If it is a promise object (i.e., a formal argument to a function) the expression slot of the promise replaces the symbol.
> * If it is an ordinary variable, its value is substituted;
> * Unless env is .GlobalEnv in which case the symbol is left unchanged.

Create examples that illustrate each of the four different cases.

_Meh._

## 19.4 Unquoting

Unquoting is one inverse of quoting. It allows you to selectively evaluate code inside `expr()`, so that `expr(!!x)` is equivalent to `x`.

### 19.4.1 Unquoting one argument

Use `!!` to unquote a single argument in a function call. `!!` takes a single expression, evaluates it, and inserts the result into the AST.

```{r}
x <- expr(a + b + c)

expr(f(!!x, y))
```

![Effects of `!!`](./imgs/bang-bang.png){width=250}

`!!` also works with symbols and constants.

```{r}
a <- sym("y")
b <- 1

expr(f(!!a, !!b))
```

![Effects of `!!` on symbol or constant](./imgs/simple.png){width=250}

If the RHS of `!!` is a function call, `!!` will evaluate it and insert the result.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(mean(x = c(1L, 2L, 3L), na.rm = TRUE))

mean_rm <- function(var) {
  var <- ensym(var)
  expr(mean(!!var, na.rm = TRUE))
}

expr(!!mean_rm(x) + !!mean_rm(y)) 
# lobstr::ast(!!mean_rm(x))
```

`!!` preserves operator precedence because it works with expressions.

```{r}
x1 <- expr(x + 1)
x2 <- expr(x + 2)

expr(!!x1 / !!x2)
```

![Effect of `!!` on operator precedence](./imgs/infix.png)

### 19.4.2 Unquoting a function

`!!` is most commonly used to replace the arguments to a function, but you can also use it to replace the function itself. The only challenge here is operator precedence: `expr(!!f(x, y))` unquotes the result of `f(x, y)`, so you need an extra pair of parentheses: `expr((!!f)(x, y))`

```{r}
f <- expr(foo)

expr((!!f)(x, y))
```

This also works when `f` itself is a call.

```{r}
f <- expr(pkg::foo)

expr((!!f)(x, y))
```

![`!!` unquoting on a function call](./imgs/fun.png){width=250}

Sometimes it'll be clearer if you use `call2()`.

```{r}
f <- expr(pkg::foo)

call2(f, expr(x), expr(y))
```

### 19.4.3 Unquoting a missing argument

[Come back to this if needed.]

### 19.4.4 Unquoting in special forms

[Come back to this if needed.]

### 19.4.5 Unquoting many arguments

`!!` is a one-to-one replacement. `!!!` (called “unquote-splice”, and pronounced bang-bang-bang) is a one-to-many replacement. It takes a list of expressions and inserts them at the location of the `!!!`.

```{r}
xs <- exprs(1, a, -b)

expr(f(!!!xs, y))
```

You can set the names of the arguments.

```{r}
named_xs <- set_names(xs, c("a", "b", "c"))

expr(f(!!!named_xs, d = 4))
```

![Effect of `!!!`](./imgs/bang-bang-bang.png){width=250}

`!!!` can be used in any rlang function that takes `...`, regardless of whether `...` is quoted or not. This can be useful in `call2()`.

```{r}
call2("f", !!!xs, expr(y))
```

### 19.4.6 The polite fiction of `!!`

[Come back to this if needed.]

### 19.4.7 Non-standard ASTs

[Come back to this if needed.]

### 19.4.8 Exercises

1. Given the following components...

```{r}
xy <- expr(x + y)
xz <- expr(x + z)
yz <- expr(y + z)
abc <- exprs(a, b, c)
```

... use quasiquotation to construct the following calls...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
(x + y) / (y + z)
-(x + z) ^ (y + z)
(x + y) + (y + z) - (x + y)
atan2(x + y, y + z)
sum(x + y, x + y, y + z)
sum(a, b, c)
mean(c(a, b, c), na.rm = TRUE)
foo(a = x + y, b = y + z)
```

```{r}
expr(!!xz / !!yz)
# expr(`^`(-!!xz, !!yz))
expr(-(!!xz)^!!yz)
expr(!!xy + !!yz - !!xy)
expr(atan2(!!xy, !!yz))
expr(sum(!!xy, !!xy, !!yz))
expr(sum(!!!abc))
expr(mean(c(!!!abc), na.rm = TRUE))
expr(foo(a = !!xy, b = !!yz))
```

2. The following two calls print the same, but are actually different

```{r}
(a <- expr(mean(1:10)))

(b <- expr(mean(!!(1:10))))

identical(a, b)
```

What's the difference? Which one is more natural?

```{r}
1:10
!!(1:10)

expr_print(1:10)
expr_print(!!(1:10))

lobstr::ast(mean(1:10))
lobstr::ast(mean(!!(1:10)))
```

It has something to do with section 19.4.7 Non-standard ASTs... but I don't care right now.

## 19.5 Non-quoting

[This section basically describes the functions in base R that effectively turn quoting off. It's an informative section if you're using/programming with those functions, but I don't think this'll have much bearing on what I'm doing.]

## 19.6 Dot-dot-dot (`...`)

What do you do if the elements you want to put in `...` are already stored in a list? For example, imagine you have a list of data frames that you want to `rbind()` together

```{r}
dfs <- list(
  a = data.frame(x = 1, y = 2),
  b = data.frame(x = 3, z = 4)
)
```

What do you do if you want to supply the argument name indirectly? For example, imagine you want to create a single column data frame where the name of the column is specified in a variable.

```{r}
var <- "x"
val <- c(4, 3, 9)
```

One way to think about these problems is to draw explicit parallels to quasiquotation:

* Row-binding multiple data frames is like unquote-splicing. We want to inline individual elements of the list into the call:

```{r}
dplyr::bind_rows(!!!dfs)
```

* The second problem is like unquoting the left-hand side of `=`. Rather than interpreting var literally, we want to use the value stored in the variable called `var`:

```{r}
tibble::tibble(!!var := val)
```

### 19.6.1 Examples

One place we could use `list2()` is to create a wrapper around `attributes()` that allows us to set attributes flexibly.

```{r}
set_attr <- function(.x, ...) {
  attr <- rlang::list2(...)
  attributes(.x) <- attr
  .x
}

attrs <- list(x = 1, y = 2)
attr_name <- "z"

int_vctr <- 1:10

set_attr(int_vctr, "w" = 0, !!!attrs, !!attr_name := 3)
```

### 19.6.2 `exec()`

If you don't want to use the tidy dots (`...`), you can use `rlang::exec()` to call a function with some arguments supplied directly by (in `...`) and other indirectly (in a list).

```{r}
# directly
exec("mean", x = 1:10, na.rm = TRUE, trim = 0.1)

# indirectly
args <- list(x = 1:10, na.rm = TRUE, trim = 0.1)
exec("mean", !!!args)

# mixed
params <- list(na.rm = TRUE, trim = 0.1)
exec("mean", x = 1:10, !!!params)
```

`rlang::exec()` also makes it possible to supply argument names indirectly.

```{r}
arg_name <- "na.rm"
arg_val <- TRUE

exec("mean", x = 1:10, !!arg_name := arg_val, trim = 0.1)
```

Lastly, it's useful if you have a vector or list of function names that you want to call with the same arguments.

```{r}
x <- c(runif(10), NA)
funs <- c("mean", "median", "sd")

purrr::map_dbl(.x = funs, .f = exec, x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

`exec()` is closely related to `call2()`; where `call2()` returns an expression, `exec()` evaluates it.

### 19.6.3 `dots_list()`

`list2()` ignores empty arguments at the end.

```{r}
list2(
  x = 5:1, 
  y = 1:5, 
  z = 3:-1,
)

list2(
  y = 1:5,
  z = 3:-1,
  x = 5:1,
)

# `list2()` is apparently in tibbles
tibble::tibble(
  y = 1:5,
  z = 3:-1,
  x = 5:1,
)
```

`list2()` is a wrapper around `rlang::dots_list()`. You can get more control by using `dots_list()` directly. 

* `.ignore_empty` allows you to control exactly which arguments are ignored
* `.homonyms` controls what happens if multiple arguments use the same name

```{r}
str(dots_list(x = 1, x = 2))

str(dots_list(x = 1, x = 2, .homonyms = "first"))

str(dots_list(x = 1, x = 2, .homonyms = "last"))

str(dots_list(x = 1, x = 2, .homonyms = "error"))
```

* If there are empty arguments that are not ignored, `.preserve_empty` controls what to do with them. The default throws an error; setting `.preserve_empty = TRUE` instead returns missing symbols. This is useful if you’re using `dots_list()` to generate function calls.

### 19.6.4 With base R

Base R provides a Swiss army knife to solve these problems: `do.call()`. `do.call()` has two main arguments. The first argument, what, gives a function to call. The second argument, `args`, is a list of arguments to pass to that function, and so `do.call("f", list(x, y, z))` is equivalent to `f(x, y, z)`.

One approach to avoiding `do.call()` is found in the `RCurl::getURL()` function written by Duncan Temple Lang. `getURL()` takes both `...` and `.opts` which are concatenated together. This looks something like this.

```{r}
f <- function(..., .dots) {
  dots <- c(list(...), .dots)
  
  # Do something
  # ...
}
```

Apparently Hadley now prefers a different approach (coming up in next section?).

### 19.6.5 Exercises

1. One way to implement `exec()` is shown below. Describe how it works. What are the key ideas?

```{r}
exec <- function(f, ..., .env = caller_env()) {
  args <- list2(...)
  do.call(f, args, envir = .env)
}
```

`f` is a length-1 character vector of the function call, like `"mean"`.

`...` are the arguments passed to the function.

With `.env` you can pass a specific environment for the function being built, but the default environment is the caller environment (the executin environment of the function that called the current function).

2. Carefully read the source code for `interaction()`, `expand.grid()`, and `par()`. Compare and contrast the techniques they use for switching between dots and list behaviour.

```{r}
interaction
```

```{r}
expand.grid
```

```{r}
par
```

Hmm... that's a lot right now. Maybe I'll come back to this.

3. Explain the problem with this definition of `set_attr()`.

```{r}
set_attr <- function(x, ...) {
  attr <- rlang::list2(...)
  attributes(x) <- attr
  x
}

set_attr(1:10, x = 10)
```

There's a name collision between the `x` that is the first argument of the function `set_attr` and the `x` that the user is hoping to set as an attribute name.
